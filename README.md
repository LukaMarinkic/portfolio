In this project I will make a python program that will calculate the Fibonacci sequence. 



## The Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. It is named after Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci, who introduced the sequence to Western Europe in the 13th century.

The sequence is often represented as:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

The Fibonacci sequence is important and fascinating for a number of reasons. First, it is a self-similar sequence, meaning that it exhibits the same pattern at all scales. This can be seen in the fact that the ratio of any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio, which is approximately 1.618.

Second, the Fibonacci sequence is found in a wide variety of natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the spiral patterns of seashells, and the branching patterns of trees. This suggests that the sequence may have some underlying mathematical or biological significance.

Third, the Fibonacci sequence has been used in a variety of applications, such as in the design of computer algorithms, the analysis of financial markets, and the creation of artistic patterns. This demonstrates the versatility and usefulness of the sequence.
