# README
Collective Repository of all my projects.

Curent projects:

* Fibbonaci.py : Generates the Fibbonaci Sequence.
* cursa.py : My learning file for learning the curses library in python. Will always do something different.

"__pycache__", ".idx" and ".vscode" were autogenerated by my IDE. Don't know what they do exactly
